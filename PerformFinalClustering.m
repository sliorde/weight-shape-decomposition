function clusters = PerformFinalClustering(data,stepSize,th)
% final clustering of data after performing replica dynamics.
% data - matrix, the result of performing replica dynamics
% stepSize - the step size used by the replica dynamics. this step size is the resolution of movement of the replicas in gradient descent, so we cluster together points that are within a distance of the step size (times 'th') from each other.
% th - we cluster together points that are within a distance of the 'stepSize*th' from each other. default value: 3
% out:
% clusters - a vector with the same number of rows as 'data', such that 'clusters(ii)' is the cluster of 'data(ii,:)'. The clusters' numbers are ordered from largest to biggest, so that cluster 1 is the largest.
